## About the Dataset
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Software Defect Dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. **For more Details about the competition you can click** [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e23).

## ⚠️

The code presented is not intended to win the competition, but to gain more knowledge on how to get started with the platform's challenges.
